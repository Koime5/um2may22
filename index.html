<h1>Other Applications of Ultrasonic sound<br>(Physics Presentation-Roll no 191 to 199)</h1>
<h2>Ultrasonic cleaning</h2>
<p>They are used for cleaning 'Hard to reach places'.e.g spiral tube<br>Objects are placed in cleaning solution<br>Ultrasound waves are passed through it.
<br>Due to high frequency, dirt and grease get detached and parts get cleaned</p>
<h2>Detecting Cracks in Metal Blocks</h2>
<p>Metal blocks are used in building bridges, machines etc<br>
Sometimes, these metal blocks look fine from outside but may
have cracks inside<br>
To detect it, ultrasound waves are passed<br>
If there is no defect, these ultrasound waves pass through and
are detected by detectors<br>
But if there is a defect, these waves reflect back (and hence
not detected by detector)
</p>
<h2>SONAR</h2>
<p>SONAR Means Sound Navigation and Ranging<br>
Ultrasound waves are used in case of underwater objects (like
submarines)<br>
It is used to find depth of sea<br>
It is also used to locate' underwater hills, valley,submarines etc
</p>
<h2>Ultrasonic sensors</h2>
  <h3><u>Types of Ultrasonic Sensors</u></h3>
<p>
There are two main types of Ultrasonic Sensors;<br>
Proximity Detection Ultrasonic Sensors - this type of ultrasonic sensor will alert the user when an object enters an area of detection. The detection
is irrespective of the objects size, material or reflectivity.<br>
Ranging Measurement Ultrasonic Sensors - this type of ultrasonic sensor can give exact measurements on the distance of an object which is
  moving to and from the sensor itself. It does this using intermittent sound waves.</p>
  <h3><u> Ultrasonic Sensor Applications</u></h3><p>
Ultrasonic sensors have been used throughout many applications and industries. They are used within food and beverage to measure liquid level
in bottles, they can be used within manufacturing for an automated process and control maximising efficiency on the factory floor.
Some of the many ultrasonic sensor applications which use Migatron sensors are;<br>
-Robotic sensing<br>
-Stacking height control<br>
-Loop control<br>
-Liquid level control<br>
-Full detection<br>
-Counting people/people detection<br>
-Presence detection<br>
-Detecting breaks in threads or wires<br>
-Box sorting<br>
-Contouring or profiling<br>
-Irregular parts detection<br>
-Tank level detection<br>
-Many applications on the production line<br>
-Distance measurement - regardless of an object's shape, color or surface texture
