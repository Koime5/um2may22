<h1>Other Applications of Ultrasonic sound<br>(Physics Presentation-Roll no 191 to 199)</h1>
    <h2>What is Ultrasonic sound?</h2>
<p>Ultra- beyond,<br>
Sound- a longitudinal wave travels through
    conduction medium</p>
    <h2>Background history of
        Ultrasound</h2>
<p>First practical application of ultrasound is
recorded during the World War I in
detecting of submarines.
The application of ultrasound in medicine
    began in fifties of last century.</p>
    <h2>How ultrasonic waves are produced?</h2>
    <p>Ultrasound wave is produced when an electric current is applied to an array of piezoelectric crystals. This causes distortion of the crystals, makes them vibrate and produce this acoustic wave. The summation of the waves produces an ultrasound beam. The ultrasound waves are produced in pulses.</p>

<h2>Ultrasonic cleaning</h2>
<p>They are used for cleaning 'Hard to reach places'.e.g spiral tube<br>Objects are placed in cleaning solution<br>Ultrasound waves are passed through it.
<br>Due to high frequency, dirt and grease get detached and parts get cleaned</p>

<h2>Detecting Cracks in Metal Blocks</h2>
<p>Metal blocks are used in building bridges, machines etc<br>
Sometimes, these metal blocks look fine from outside but may
have cracks inside<br>
To detect it, ultrasound waves are passed<br>
If there is no defect, these ultrasound waves pass through and
are detected by detectors<br>
But if there is a defect, these waves reflect back (and hence
not detected by detector)

<h2>SONAR</h2>
<p>SONAR Means Sound Navigation and Ranging<br>
Ultrasound waves are used in case of underwater objects (like
submarines)<br>
It is used to find depth of sea<br>
It is also used to locate' underwater hills, valley,submarines etc
</p>

    <h2>Echolocation</h2>
    <p>Echolocation is the process where sound waves and
echoes are used to determine objects in space.
Echolocation is used by bats to navigate and find
their food in the dark.
Bats send out sound waves
from their mouth and nose, which then hit the objects
in their vicinity producing echoes,
which are then
received by the bats. The nature of the echo helps
them determine the size, the shape and the distance
of the object.

    <h2>Ultrasonic sensors</h2>
  <h3><u>Types of Ultrasonic Sensors</u></h3>
<p>
There are two main types of Ultrasonic Sensors;<br>
Proximity Detection Ultrasonic Sensors - this type of ultrasonic sensor will alert the user when an object enters an area of detection. The detection
is irrespective of the objects size, material or reflectivity.<br>
Ranging Measurement Ultrasonic Sensors - this type of ultrasonic sensor can give exact measurements on the distance of an object which is
  moving to and from the sensor itself. It does this using intermittent sound waves.</p>
  <h3><u> Ultrasonic Sensor Applications</u></h3><p>
Ultrasonic sensors have been used throughout many applications and industries. They are used within food and beverage to measure liquid level
in bottles, they can be used within manufacturing for an automated process and control maximising efficiency on the factory floor.
Some of the many ultrasonic sensor applications which use Migatron sensors are;<br>
-Robotic sensing<br>
-Stacking height control<br>
-Loop control<br>
-Liquid level control<br>
-Full detection<br>
-Counting people/people detection<br>
-Presence detection<br>
-Detecting breaks in threads or wires<br>
-Box sorting<br>
-Contouring or profiling<br>
-Irregular parts detection<br>
-Tank level detection<br>
-Many applications on the production line<br>
-Distance measurement - regardless of an object's shape, color or surface texture
