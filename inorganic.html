            <h2>Elements</h2>
            <p>-cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means.</p>
            <h2>Atoms</h2>
            <p>-the smallest part of the molecule that take part in chemical change.</p>
            <h2>Proton Number</h2>
            <p>-number of protons in the nucleus of the atom is called the proton number or the atomic number.</p>
            <h2>Nucleon Number</h2>
            <p>-number of protons+neutrons in the nucleus of the atom is called the nucleon number or the mass number.</p>
            <h2>Isotopes</h2>
            <p>Atoms of the same elements with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.</p>
            <p>(Different isotopes of the same element have the same chemical properties but may have slightly different physical properties.)</p>
            <h2>Radioisotopes</h2>
            <p>If an isotopes is radioactive,
                <br>-its nucleus is unstable
                <br>-it breaks down over a period of time - it decays
                <br>-as it decays, the nucleus gives out tiny particles or rays
                <br>These isotopes are called radioisotopes.
            </p>
            <h2>Uses of radioisotopes</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>medicine, industry and for military purposes</li>
                    <li>to date ancient remains</li>
                    <li>the home and workplace(the radioisotpe americium-241 is used in smoke detectors)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Medical uses of radioisotopes</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to kill cancer cells(isotope of colbolt)</li>
                    <li>treatment of overactive thyroid glands and locating tumours in the body</li>
                    <li>to sterilise medical equipment</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>NMR</h2>
            <p>NMR(nuclear magnetic resonance) is an experimental method of the following 
                biochemical reactions in both cells and entire organs under normal physiological condition.
                <br>The principle of NMR is that a sample is placed in a strong magnetic field and subjected
                to radio waves of a frequency appropriate to the nucleus of the element being studied.
                <br>For biochemical work, <sup>31</sup>P and <sup>13</sup>C are frequently used.
                <br>NMR has the advantage of not using radiation, such as x rays, which have very harmful side effects.
                <br>The use of NMR for medical diagnosis of brain and heart damage resulting from strokes or heart attacks is just beginning.
